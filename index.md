## My name is Akki Poojari

I am a freshman here at Purdue. My hometown is Overland Park, Kansas, which is about 15 minutes from Kansas City, Missouri. In accordance, I am a huge Kansas City Chiefs fan and I basically live for football. I have a younger brother named Anish. We both play tennis but he is better for his age as he is top 10 in the country. Though I miss home, I am excited for the next 4 years here at Purdue!
